# Decimal to Binary converter

Hi this is Amrit, a newbie cpp programmer who started to learn cpp a few days ago.

Anyways, this was my first newbie project that I worked on. It's really simple you just put in the decimal number you desire and this will display your binary code.

The project makes use of for loop, array, some integers and some arithmetic operators to do the conversion. Now in my opinion this felt goood to me, as a beginner seeing my code do something felt great and I look forward learning more c++ and contributing to the community.
